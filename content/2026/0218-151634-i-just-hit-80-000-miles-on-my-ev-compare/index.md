I just hit **80,000 miles** on my EV.

Compared to my previous gas car, **fuel + maintenance was ~78% less**.

I spent **~$3,800** on electricity.  
The battery weighs **~1,000 lb** and took **~10,000 lb of CO₂** to produce *(one time)*.

For context, my gas car would have needed:
- **~3,800 gallons** of gas  
- **~$17,000** in fuel + oil changes  
- **~24,000 lb** of gasoline burned  
- **~75,000 lb** of CO₂ emitted  

**Net:** I saved **~$13,000** and **~65,000 lb of CO₂**.
