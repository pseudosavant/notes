One of things I've found to be critical for agentic coding/product is managing context so that I don't have to keep explaining something to the agent. This is a very useful process I've adopted for keep track of and reloading context. I have a WIP\ folder in my cloud drive on my computer. Whenever I work on something I will ask it to Use and update the agent WIP log here: 'C:\Users\paul\OneDrive\WIP\workitem-3141.md'. Then when I come back on another day (new PR to check, etc), even on a different machine with the cloud drive, I can ask for it to use that WIP log and pick up right where we left off.
