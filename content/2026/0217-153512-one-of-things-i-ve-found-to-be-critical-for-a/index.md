One of things I've found to be critical for agentic coding/product is managing context so that I don't have to keep explaining something to the agent. This is a very useful process I've adopted to keep track of, and reload, context.

I have a WIP\ folder in my cloud drive on my computer. Whenever I work on something I ask it to use and update the agent WIP log here: 'C:\Users\paul\OneDrive\WIP\workitem-3141.md'. When I come back on another day (new PR to check, etc), even on a different machine with the cloud drive, I can ask it to use that WIP log to pick up right where we left off.
